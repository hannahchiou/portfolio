<h2> Subtheme: Speculation </h2>
<h3> Overall questions: </h3>
<h3> 1. Are there any patterns to vacancies and/or housing availability around the Greater Boston area? </h3> 
<p> The article about Boston’s ultra luxe “towers of wealth” reminded me about a recent trip to New York to visit a friend. As we strolled around Central Park, she remarked on the impossible to miss shadow of the Central Park Tower, adding that many of the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/american-housing-has-gone-insane/605005/">high rises of Manhattan </a>remain empty (not to mention prohibitively expensive for the average NYC resident). This reminded me of some videos I’d seen on the past on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wehsz38P74g&t=253s">New York’s empty “Billionaires’ Row"</a> which echoed many of the readings, explaining that financial capitalism in the 21st century has shifted in such a way that real estate has moved down the liquidity spectrum to become more like a stock or cash. The video also brought up a term coined by Jonny Aspen, a urban studies professor: <a href="https://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2016/08/zombie-urbanism.html">“zombie urbanism”</a>, used to describe a city that has a lot of sold housing units but aren’t lived in. Both from a material perspective and from a urban planning / urban studies perspective, having extremely expensive housing sitting empty in cities that are also in the throes of housing crises has always baffled me. As such, I’d like to explore vacancies (if such data is available) and patterns of availability in Boston. </p>

<h3>2. What would be the potential effects of a transfer policy enactment? How do Mayor Wu and Governor Healey's respective proposals compare in the context of Boston?</h3>
<p> Learning about speculation wasn’t just eye-opening — it also interested me in learning what can actually be done about the issue and ensuring greater housing equity. Both the Boston Globe ‘Towers of Wealth’ article and the Homes for Profit site mentioned transfer fees (taxes on a certain portion of a real estate property above a certain threshold) as a possible policy solution. A quick Google search informed me that there are actually <a href="https://www.bmrb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RU42624transferfee.pdf">two different transfer fee policies </a>that are being floated in MA state legislation. I wanted to explore different aspects of these proposals. For example, where would a $2 million cutoff (Mayor Wu’s proposal) in Boston occur and what properties / who would it affect? What about Governor Healey’s proposal,  with the first $1.0 million or county median price? (For context, Suffolk County’s median home sale in 2023 was $709,125, meaning Boston’s initial threshold would be set at $1.0 million.) And would these transfer fees actually target investor / private equity groups? </p>

<h3>3. Are there any patterns to "flipping" in the Greater Boston area? Where does flipping primarily occur? Who does it affect?</h3>
<p> A metaphor that stood out to me in the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/when-private-equity-becomes-your-landlord">ProPublica article</a> was how private equity firms act like corporate house flippers: “They seek deals on apartment buildings, slash costs or hike rents to boost income, then unload the buildings at a higher price.” But it’s clear that this isn’t just a metaphor — investor groups often do actually purchase properties and resell them for higher. Although the data can’t speak for the quality of the properties after flipping, we can figure out some important information about the flips themselves, such as where they often occur and the percentage price change. Gathering more information about potential price increases is especially crucial, given that Boston’s prohibitively high costs are an important aspect of the housing crisis. </p>
