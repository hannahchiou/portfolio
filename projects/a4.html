<ul>
    <li>The bar graph clearly illustrates that many of the states that had decreases in abortion rates were conservative (coded in red). Furthermore, the 5 states that had the <em>greatest</em> overall decreases were all conservative.</li>
    <li>I subsetted the first 20 states, first because there were several states that had 0 reported changes in abortion rates, and secondly, there were other conservative states that had reported <em>increases</em> in abortion rates, which wouldn’t have helped my narrative overall. Actually, one of my original visualizations included all of the states, removing outliers like Oklahoma that had a 100% increase in abortion rate. However, I realized that it had a lot of information in one chart that readers might be able to interpret differently / against the proposition (for example, some conservative states had positive increases in abortion rates).</li>
    <li>Additionally, by subsetting these states, the bar graph changed scales from having both positive and negative values to only have negative values, which draws the viewer’s attention to the downward bars.</li>
    <li>Overall, I think this visualization works because the color scheme is quite simple and the red / conservative pops out against the gray. One area of improvement is the axis — is it immediately clear to viewers that the axis is negative? Maybe the bars could be labeled in a way that makes it easier to read. I also think some annotations for the states with the most major decreases that describe what the state and/or federal policies that might have led to abortion rate decreases could add more insight for readers.</li>
    <li>Another alternative I considered was a scatterplot that showed the decrease in abortion rates vs. the number of abortion clinics or providers, colored by liberal or conservative states and using a size mark to further illustrate the change in abortion rates. I realized this visualization, like the other visualization I considered, gives viewers “too much” information that could be interpreted differently.</li>

    <li>I’m trying to show here that whether states are conservative or liberal (marked using color) had no effect on the change in the number of abortion clinics and providers, as illustrated by the trend line that showed very weak correlation.</li>
    <li>There were several things here that I think make this visualization more deceptive than my other visualization. First of all, I removed what looked a bit like an outlier (Missouri, which had a 100% increase in the number of providers and was skewing the trend line considerably. After removing Missouri, the trend line got much flatter / the correlation looked much weaker). As I discuss in my reflection, it goes against statistical / data vis best practices to not disclose when you have outliers. Additionally, the change in abortion providers and abortion clinics are on different time scales (2014-2017 and 2017-2020, respectively). Again, this isn’t disclosed on the axes, which may cause viewers to think these changes were happening during the same time period. Finally, there were significant trend differences in conservative vs liberal vs mixed states. Of course, these lines are not represented, and we just have the aggregated average trend line instead, which shows a much weaker / random correlation between abortion clinic and provider changes.</li>
    <li>I had some difficulty coming up with relationships between variables that would <em>not</em> show a link between abortion rates and state government. In the end, that’s why I ended up using tangentially related variables, namely change in abortion clinics and change in abortion providers. However, this is a critique I have of the visualization — a viewer may not immediately draw the connection between these variables and the actual number of abortions. The viewer is left to draw a lot of conclusions on their own based on their preexisting knowledge of Democrat vs Republican views on abortion rights.</li>
    <li>I thought about making a heatmap of some sort to show that certain variables were weakly correlated with each other, but I wasn’t sure how familiar the general public was with interpreting heatmaps / correlation coefficients.</li>
  </ul>

<h2> Reflection </h2>
<p> It was straightforward to come up with ideas that would support the side of the proposition I agreed with, but it was more difficult to create visualizations that would support the other side, especially since it seemed like that data more strongly supported a link between conservative states and decreases in abortion rates and access. To get around this, I ended up using some other correlated variables to abortion rates, which is another method of deception (see description). It was also pretty straightforward to choose the most clear and interpretable encodings and marks (color for party, type of graph, etc). </p>
<p> I found the overall premise of willfully designing misleading graphs to be quite challenging, especially due to my background as a data science student. There’s a common aphorism in statistics from British statistician George Box that says, “All models are wrong, some are useful”. The quote, when applied to statistics and data science, stresses that the mathematical models that we create are only abstractions that fail to represent the complexities of the real world. In many of my classes, this principle has shaped our approaches to writing reports and creating visualizations — we know our models and statistical techniques are not completely accurate to life, so given that, how do we effectively and transparently communicate some of the complications in our data and our proposed models? As such, it pained me to do things like exclude outliers without explicitly noting it on the visualization, or to adjust axes to an inaccurate scale. </p>
<p> Now, I would define “ethical analysis and visualization” as one that is honest about what it does and doesn’t show, and recognizes its own shortcomings or ways it may be misinterpreted. I don’t think ethical visualization needs to be entirely objective — it’s inevitable that our own perspectives will shape the final product. Visualizations should still be persuasive and tell a story, but it should not do so by intentionally obscuring information or misleading viewers via confusing or unclear visual techniques. I think acceptable persuasive choices include color, sorting, marks, etc. but it veers into misleading territory when we begin to try to change our underlying data, such as exaggerating differences via truncation or improper scaling or removing categories or outliers without disclosure, or <i> purposefully </i> employ confusing techniques. </p>
