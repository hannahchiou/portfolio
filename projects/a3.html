<h2> Reading and Critique </h2>
<h3> Insights </h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Number of new cases tend to ebb and flow, with varying peaks
            <ul>
                <li>Seems to be driven by the seasons, but not entirely → other factors include vaccine rollout and new more infectious variants</li>
                <li>Patterns may reflect new variants which had greater transmissibility</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Large number of cases around November, December, January, and February, especially in 2021 (makes sense given winter → higher transmission)</li>
        <li>Slow down in April and lowest point of pandemic thus far around May, June, July 2021
            <ul>
                <li>Deployment of COVID-19 vaccines</li>
                <li>Have not reached that low of new number of cases since</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Peak again around September, October 2021 and slight slow down thereafter</li>
        <li>Explosion of cases around late December and January 2022 → Omicron variant (seems to be more infectious than previous variants). Seems to point to a concerning development…</li>
    </ul>

<h3> Critique </h3>

<p> I think there are a couple things that the visualization does well. For one, this manner of visualizing COVID-19 data is much more engaging than the typical bar charts and line charts we were often inundated with during the pandemic and likely caught the interest of viewers based on visual interest alone. The data is shown in a more consolidated form appropriate for a website or newspaper, as opposed to stretching out the years across a linear axis, so viewers can more readily get information in one image. Viewers can see the distribution and pattern of COVID-19 cases and compare it across the same time each year without having to scroll / look across a long visualization. Given that the visualization appeared in an op-ed about the potential dangers of a new COVID variant appearing during the winter, when COVID-19 transmissions tended to be highest, the data clearly reveals trends in the data based on season. The labelled months help roughly divide the data into seasons, making it clear that April to July tends to have the lowest number of cases across the year. The visual helps underscore Dr. Shaman’s intended message of the threat of Omicron and provides motivation for his writing about the future of the pandemic and projections of infections. Finally, it’s visually legible, with appropriate spacing given to each year and between each month so annotations and labels are clearly visible.  </p>

<p> However, I believe there are several issues with the visualization that make it more confusing than needed. One of the most glaring issues is that it is not immediately obvious how to read the visualization given the novel shape. As such, the target audience (the everyday American who reads the NYT) might not be able to understand the message of the visualization at first glance. The combination of the spiral shape and use of size to represent cases makes it hard to actually get a sense of the scale, since the highlight that represents cases wraps around both sides of the line. In addition, because the highlight is not discretely broken up across weeks, it makes it even harder to discern actual numbers across the pandemic. 0-150k cases is also quite a wide range, so it’s not easy to convert the size of the highlight to actual numbers. Viewers only get a very general sense of case trends, but don’t have a good sense of the scale / concrete numbers of US cases. In general, the viewer has to fill in a lot of the gaps on their own. For example, not all of the months are labelled so the viewer has to figure out the tick marks for the other months. Viewers may wonder about other factors besides season / time of year that may be affecting the presented trends — annotations pointing out when new variants emerged, when vaccine rollouts began, or when certain mandates were put in place could provide additional information, instead of making the viewer try to remember what happened in regards to COVID over the past 2 years (which, given the pandemic fatigue by 2022, was probably not very much!). Another way annotation could have been used was to call out certain important numbers (eg. when new cases were lowest and highest and why). Finally, if Dr. Shaman’s goal was to emphasize how important it was to take steps against the new Omicron variant, I think he could have underscored this by a) explicitly calling out the January 2022 numbers and pointing out how much higher they were compared to previous years, b) showing the impact of vaccines on new cases, and / or c) including and comparing the number of deaths due to COVID.  </p>

<h2> Visualization Sketches </h2>
<h3> Visualization 1 </h3>
<img src="../images/A3-1.jpg" width="1000px">
<ul>
    <li>I wanted to keep in an aspect of easily spotting trends across the different seasons / times of year. This visualization was an attempt to allow for easy comparison across the years and seasons without utilizing the overly unfamiliar format of a spiral. I used the <strong>color</strong> marking to differentiate between years.</li>
    <li>On the plus side, I think it’s relatively straightforward and easy to read because most people know how to read a line chart. Though not particularly creative, it helps viewers spot overall trends quickly.</li>
    <li>I do wonder how taking monthly averages compared to 7-day rolling averages might affect perceptions of trends over time. I’m not a public health expert, but from my quick research, 7-day averages are preferred over daily or monthly numbers because they were able to balance the variability of daily tests (which varied based on weekends, holidays, etc.) with quicker overall trend detection.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Visualization 2 </h3>
<img src="../images/A3-4.jpg" width="1000px">
<ul>
    <li> I experimented a bit with possible data transformations. Here, I tried percentage change in new cases because I thought that would be an intuitive way to showcase where there were notable spikes or dips in case numbers.</li>
    <li>Like my previous sketch, I think it’s pretty easy to read. The format of a line chart split on different years (using different colors) is approachable and we continue to get the sense of changes along the year.</li>
    <li>However, we lose the sense of absolute scale because the percent increases are relative to each other — so we’re not exactly sure what a 20% increase in cases between 2 months means because we might not know how many cases there were in the first month. This could be aided with some annotations or tooltip labels but I worried that this would make the visualization too busy.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Visualization 3 </h3>
<img src="../images/A3-2.jpg" width="1000px">
<ul>
    <li>I wanted to see if there were ways to iterate on the preexisting spiral design, because I did really appreciate its visual uniqueness and concise design.</li>
    <li>As I mentioned in my critique, it was not easy to get a sense of the actual numbers or scale of COVID cases because there were no markings or labels outside of size. This visualization was a way of adding some concreteness to the averages by allowing for labels to show up when hovering / using a tooltip, in addition to using the size marking.</li>
    <li>Like in the previous visualization, I used different colors to more clearly differentiate between the 3 years — not everyone will immediately notice the January label at the top of the original spiral (I certainly didn’t and, before taking a closer look at labels and legends, was left wondering what the overall spiral was representing).</li>
    <li>I also labeled a few things around the spiral, such as when vaccine rollouts started and peaks of cases (more as proof of concept, I didn’t use exact dates and numbers) because I thought the original visualization could have used more contextualization.</li>
    <li>Even after attempting to improve on the original visualization, I still wasn’t convinced of the format’s overall efficacy because the spiral shape was just hard to read. I decided to explore other visual forms after this attempt.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Visualization 4 </h3>
<img src="../images/A3-3.jpg" width="1000px">
<ul>
    <li>I wanted to keep exploring other visual forms than the traditional bar chart or line chart because they were overused in the COVID context. I wanted to experiment with a radar chart, which would combine a more unique non-linear format with more concreteness / sense of scale (using the inner lines as “axes”).</li>
    <li>The radar chart would preserve a sense of seasonal trend by having the months on the outer rings. Viewers would also be able to compare the same month during different years based on the different colored radar areas.</li>
    <li>There were a few things that made me hesitate to use this visualization though. For one, I worried that the overlap of the different colors would make it hard to read in a non-interactive context. I also still wasn’t sure if a circular format would be easy to interpret.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Final Visualization Design </h2>
<img src="../images/Untitled document-1.png" width="1000px">

<h2> Design Process and Decision Decisions </h2>
<p> For my visualization, I wanted to stick with the takeaway I got from Dr. Shaman’s original visualization, which was about seasonal trends and the concerning transmissibility of the Omicron variant. Even though I originally wanted to have a more creative visual format, some experimentation (see Reflection section) yielded less effective and harder to read visualizations. Since the original visual was targeted for a general audience, I decided to apply Occam’s razor and go with the most interpretable visual. I decided to include small multiples of both cases and deaths; I hoped that viewers would be able to get a sense of how vaccines helped prevent some deaths, if not all cases, over time. I think the medium of a stacked area chart helps people easily compare proportions across the same time. For both charts, I calculated the 7 day average not only because this was used in Dr. Shaman’s visual but also because this seemed to be best practice in epidemiology / public health (also see Visualization 1 bullet points). I used the simple mark of color to differentiate between years in both the cases and deaths charts. I also added some simple annotations to help readers get a sense of what was happening throughout the pandemic. However, it’s important to note that because I was taking the 7 day rolling average, the axis is missing monthly labels so viewers may get a general sense of time and seasons across the year but it’s not as explicit as it could be. Also, in the deaths chart, the 2021 area is stuck behind the 2022 curve, making it hard to see (it’s a little easier to isolate for it in the interactive Tableau version, of course). I also think that because line charts were so utilized in the pandemic, we lose the severity of the lives and experiences lost as a result of COVID — data visualizations can only do so much to encompass the damage done by the pandemic. </p>

<h3> Reflection </h3>
<p> The lack of creativity aside, I do think my critiques in Step 2 did help guide my approach for my final visualization. I realized that for this visualization, it was important to properly contextualize and annotate the data in order to communicate the overall message of sustained pandemic awareness.  </p>

<p>I actually experimented with some of the more visually creative potential visualizations before landing on a simple area chart. When I tried a radar chart (I used a Tableau viz extension), I ran into the issue that I foresaw in my bullet points, which was the overlapping colors / areas. There was also a huge spike in early 2022 with as many as 6 million new cases a day, which made the relatively less extreme numbers of 2020 and 2021 very hard to notice, let alone read. A log transformation of cases was both unhelpful in the new visualization and also not as easily interpretable. </p>

<p> I also tried a stream chart, which displays values over a varying baseline. Though it looked really nice, it’s not exactly the most intuitive format because the areas are <i>in proportion </i>to each other. Someone reading quickly might think interpret the entire stacked area incorrectly. Also, because there’s no scale, this visual is better off as an interactive piece rather than a static one. </p>

<img src="../images/streamgraph.png" height="500px"> 

<p> As I mentioned before though, I do wish there was a way to emphasize the cost of the pandemic on American lives — perhaps an interactive / animated visual could better tell a narrative on COVID-19’s effects. </p>
